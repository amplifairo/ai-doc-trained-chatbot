Do you have a question?

Can GrowCentric integrate with our existing sales teams and processes?

Yes, our approach is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing sales teams and processes. We focus on complementing and enhancing your current efforts, ensuring a synergistic approach to achieving sales goals.

Won't we lose control over our sales process?

Not at all. Our collaboration model ensures that you remain in control of the major decision-making process, while we handle the execution and provide expert guidance. You will be informed about all our activity, weekly reports, and meetings.  

Isn't outsourcing sales more expensive than having an in-house team?

Sales outsourcing can be more cost-effective. You save on the money, time, and focus typically invested in recruiting processes, onboarding new colleagues, sales training, team management, specialized sales and communication software & hardware, team-building activities, bonuses, and other benefits. Additionally, you gain access to a team of experts in business development and advanced industry technology without the overhead costs. However, you don’t need to outsource your entire team. We can cover a part of your team or handle a segment of the process.  

Will GrowCentric be able to understand our product/service as well as our in-house team?

Our approach involves a deep dive into your products/services, ensuring our understanding is as comprehensive as your in-house team’s. This depth of knowledge allows us to represent your offerings authentically and effectively. However, there are situations where services are too complex for an external sales team to sell. In such cases, we focus solely on generating meetings with new leads for your sales team.  

How quickly can we see results from outsourcing sales?

The timeline for seeing results varies based on the service, brand awareness, pricing, and industry, but generally, it spans 3-6 months. We require 2-4 weeks for setup before we can begin selling your services. Additionally, consider the average time needed to convert a client from the first cold contact in your industry  

How can I start working with GrowCentric?

Getting started with GrowCentric is simple. Contact us through our website or email, hello@growcentric.ro, and we’ll schedule a consultation to discuss your business needs and how our services can align with your growth objectives.  

How quickly can GrowCentric deploy a sales team for our project?

We require 2-4 weeks for setup before we can begin selling your services.  

What kind of reporting and analytics does GrowCentric provide?

We provide comprehensive insights into our sales activities, including conversion rates, results generated, details of calls and meetings, client feedback, competitive intelligence, and customer trends.  

Is there a minimum contract period for GrowCentric’s sales services?

A minimum contract period consisting of the setup period plus 3 months of implementation is necessary to ensure meaningful results, but we recommend at least 6 months. We aim for long-term partnerships, as B2B is a marathon, not a sprint. After the initial 3 months, we understand the need for flexibility, and you can cancel at any time with a 30-day notice.
